<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Chapter 3 - Typesetting Mathematical Formulae</b></h2><div>If you want to typeset (advanced) mathematics, you should use AMS-LATEX. &nbsp;The AMS-LATEX bundle is a collection of packages and classes for mathematical typesetting. &nbsp;AMS-LATEX is produced by <i>The American Mathematical Society</i> and it is used extensively for mathematical typesetting. &nbsp;LATEX itself does provide some basic features and environments for mathematics, but they are limited and in some cases inconsistent. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>AMS-LATEX is a part of the required distribution and is provided with all recent LATEX distributions. &nbsp;We assume amsmath is loaded in the preamble; \usepackage{amsmath}.</div><div></div><div></div>
