Packages such as geometry, hyphenate, and many others are typically made up of two files: a file with the extension .ins and another with the extension .dtx<br></div><div><br></div><div>Once you have copied the package files onto your machine, you still have to process them in a way that:<br></div><ol><li><div>tells your TeX distribution about the new style package<br></div><ol><li><div>Run LaTeX on the .ins file, this will extract a .sty file<br></div></li><li><div>Move the .sty file to a place where your distribution can find it<br></div></li><li><div>Refresh your distribution's file-name database. &nbsp;The command depends on the LaTeX distribution you use: texlive - texhash, maktexlsr, initexmf --update-fndb<br></div></li></ol></li><li><div>gives you the documentation<br></div><ol><li><div>Run LaTeX on the .dtx file. &nbsp;This will generate a .dvi file<br></div></li><li><div>Check to see if LaTeX has produced a .idx file among the various files you now have<br></div></li><li><div>In order to generate the index, type the following: makeindex -s gind.ist [name] (where name stands for the main-file name without any extension)<br></div></li><li><div>Run LaTeX on the .dtx file<br></div></li><li><div>Last but not least, make a .ps or .pdf file to increase your reading pleasure<br></div></li></ol></li></ol><div><br></div><div><b>4.7 Working with pdfLaTeX</b><br></div><div>Most web pages you find today are written in HTML. &nbsp;This format has two significant disadvantages when writing scientific documents:<br></div><ol><li><div>Including mathematical formulae into HTML documents is not generally supported. &nbsp;While there is a standard for it, most browsers used today do not support it, or lack the required fonts.<br></div></li><li><div>Printing HTML documents is possible, but the results vary widely between platforms and browsers. &nbsp;The results are miles removed from the quality we have come to expect in the LaTeX world.<br></div></li></ol><div><b>4.7.1 PDF Documents for the Web</b><br></div><div>The creation of a PDF file from LaTeX source is very simple, thanks to pdfTEX which produces PDF output where normal TEX produces DVI. &nbsp;There is also a pdfLaTeX, which produces PDF output from LaTeX sources.<br></div><div><br></div><div>To produce a PDF instead of DVI, it is sufficient to replace the command latex file.tex by pdflatex file.tex. &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>4.7.2 The Fonts</b><br></div><div><b></b><br></div>
